# The ASP.NET/Vue Client Application

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3, Vite and ASP.NET. You can run this application in isolation (from the API) using `npm run dev` in this directory.

You can run it alongside the API if you run `npm run dev` in the root.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Build and Deployment

The ASP.NET Minimal API project has build settings configured to build your client app for production when you run `dotnet publish` or `dotnet build`. This client app will be compiled and the output in `/dist` will be copied over to `wwwroot` of the API.

Deployment scripts are setup for you in `/Deployment` and come preconfigured for Azure deployment or Docker deployment.
